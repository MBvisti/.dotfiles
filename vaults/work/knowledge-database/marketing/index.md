## Storytelling

[source](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVvcK74h1Mg)
Reasons people ramble/communicate in a way that's hard to understand:
1. Lack of a point
2. No structure
3. Lacking specificity

All of the above can be tackled using frameworks that can be practiced.

Fixes to the above in order:
1. "The one thing you need to know about TOPIC is X"
Using language to guide thinking prohibits rambling. It doesn't stop it, but at least it helps you get to _a point_ faster. This doesn't have to a groundbreaking truth but it does need to give direction and claritiy. Continuing this exercise will refine the idea more and more.

2. Use a 3-line scene
The first line comes from point 1: the one thing you need to know. It sets the scene and puts people "on the edge"

The second line has to add depth and this can be done either digging deeper into the-one-point or you can introduce "a surprise". The latter is very similar to how south park talks about telling a story: this happened - but or  there this happen -> therefore this happens.

The third line answers the "what's next" by either introducing a discussion point or you can close it by "and that's because __"

3. Via negativa
Talking about what something is _not_ are often easier than talking about what something _is_. "What I want in life" is much harder to clearly communicate compared to "what I don't want in life". So, one way to create specificity is telling what something isn't.

If you write out your story or explanation and the word "and then" fits between each section/part, it's boring.

## Content

### Blog Posts

Target keywords goes in url, h1 (limit to 60-70 characters), intro, h2 (for question), h3 (for the answer) - after that, make the article good.

### LinkedIn

**Cyril Khan**

Expert post outline:
Headline -> story with issue -> implementation -> conclusion -> call to action

Social post outline:
Headline -> initial situation -> insight -> implementation -> result/summary -> call to action

**[Demandcurve](https://www.demandcurve.com/playbooks/linkedin-organic)**

Ideas become insights when they hit the following criteria:
- Novel—is this idea new or is it at least a fresh take on an existing idea?
- Actionable—can my audience immediately act on the idea?
- High-leverage — when my audience acts on the idea, can it meaningfully change their work or their lives?

Insights are rarely brand new, but they're recycled and repurposed from others. We suggest sourcing insights by:
- Consuming content from thought leaders in your area of expertise: sign up for newsletters, curate your social media feeds, and listen to valuable podcasts.
- Connect with the brightest minds in your field and consistently work through cutting-edge techniques and solutions to the largest problems impacting the field—for example, we chat with other top growth agency founders to trade learnings at least once a month.

Two themes: industry-focused & human-focused

Industry focused:
- Insights that shows you as a thought leader in X industry. Should be priority.

Human focused:
- Aim is to connect on a human level. Focus on story-telling and vulnerability.

Post structures:
- Pure Text
- Resources
- Stories

**Pure Text** is as the name suggest: pure text. Stick to 1-2 sentence paragraphs, avoid long ones as most traffic comes from mobile. The elements of a good pure text post:
- Lead with a hook: posts gets truncated so only first two sentences are shown with a "read more" btn.
- Add context
- End with a zinger

Elements of good hook:
- Ask tantalizing question
- Imply something controversial

Examples of good hooks:
- An unbelievable statistic or quote
- A startling failure you experienced
- Stating that the status quo is wrong
- A self-evident description of a useful resource, e.g. "My favorite tools for creating landing pages are..."

Elements of good context:
- should setup the "zinger"
- could be a human element (?)

Elements of good zinger:
- should be an insight bomb
- leaves reader with something to think about

**Resource posts** follows same structure as above but adds a media resource instead of a "zinger".

Elements of good resource posts:
- the image asset should be the insight
- show things they can replicate, like infographic/spreadsheets/etc

**Story posts** makes people built affinity towards you. They build trust.

Elements of good story posts:
- A lesson you learned the hard way
- A funny encounter you had
- Poke fun at an ironic way people do things
- Stories about challenging yourself

**Final touches**
- Send conn. reqs. to people that like your posts
- Ask for comments, this is __the__ measure for linkedin to boost a post. Like content with convos.

Examples of how to ask for comments:
- "Leave a comment below if you recommend another resource."
- "How often does this happen to you? Respond here and let me know."
- "Do you have any stories like this of your own?"
- "What hacks do you use for accomplishing X?"

**When and how much to post**:
- often and consistenly
- around 08:30am in your audience's timezone
- try and comment on other people's posts.

### Twitter/X

### YouTube

### AI Templates

What the gurus talk about:
- provide the AI with some structure on how to write the post (sections, tone, etc)
- provide with some keyword to focus on
- most use a template that describes the overall desired output and change with some variable.
- double check with "AI Written checker" to see if it will get caught
- generate an outline
