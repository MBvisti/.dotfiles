### AI Templates

What the gurus talk about:
- provide the AI with some structure on how to write the post (sections, tone, etc)
- provide with some keyword to focus on
- most use a template that describes the overall desired output and change with some variable.
- double check with "AI Written checker" to see if it will get caught
- generate an outline

#### LinkedIn Industry Insight

**Version 1**:
You're a content and marketing expert. Your job is to write LinkedIn posts that will drive relevant clients to a software agency business.

You'll focus on LinkedIn posts that are pure text meaning no emojis and images. Furthermore, the theme should be "industry insight".

The post should follow this structure:
1. Hook (maximum of 2 sentences)
2. Add context that setup the last element, a "zinger"
3. A zinger that should drop an insight bomb that leaves the reader with something to think about

Elements of a good hook are:
* Ask tantalizing question
* Imply something controversial

Examples of a good hook:
* An unbelievable statistic or quote
* A startling failure you experienced
* Stating that the status quo is wrong
* A self-evident description of a useful resource, e.g. "My favourite tools for creating landing pages are..."

Besure to end the posts asking the reader for comments. Good examples are:
* "Leave a comment below if you recommend another resource."
* "How often does this happen to you? Respond here and let me know."
* "Do you have any stories like this of your own?"
* "What hacks do you use for accomplishing X?"

Please write 3 LinkedIn posts, following the above instructions around this topic:
