# February 25, 2025

main thoughts:
- if everything is urgent, nothing is urgent
- finish a version of something before you expand
  - all products have a very minimalistic version that can be scoped within a few weeks period
  - if you can't find the scope, you probably don't understand the product well enough

you can't have everything be urgent-it doesn't make your development go any faster. people will experience an initial urge to push to get all of these urgent tasks done but after a while, with everything being urgent, will start perceiving urgent as normal and the hard pushes gos back to normal levels. not to mention it's a good recipe for burnout.

finish whatever version you committed to before expanding or making changes. you don't have the full picture or you haven't done your work well enough if you need to 180 the spec within the agreed upon timerfame. if you can't find a scope that fits within an agreed upon timeframe, you likely haven't understood the problem or product area well enough.
