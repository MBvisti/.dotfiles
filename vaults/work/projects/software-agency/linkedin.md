## Content Ideas

- Zero-downtime deploys on a VPS
- using embeddings for social listening
- ~how to think about software development: YAGNI, less is more, YANM you are not meta etc~
- reduce your components, lessons from musk
~- requirements are inherently unclear, that's why we iterate~
- dedicate time for developers to clean under the carpet, i.e. the pile that has been swept under the rug
- your grand parents had it right; not every solution needs to be solved with the latest advancement in tech or html, css, js is probably fine
- microservices are a good solution on paper; terrible in real life
- if your team consists of engineers early on in their career, allocate time for building prototypes. Unknown Unknowns
- learn how to install your own software (riff on the important of knowing how to configure and setup the tools you use and not just use version managers)
- I quit my job, moved to Berlin and started freelancing
- One of the most productive teams I worked on, was remote-first
- my favorite tool for database/sql is sqlc combined with squrriel
- my favorite tool for views are templ
- benefits of types and staying in one language
- what's the simplest you can do for hosting Go apps? (vps, systemd guide)

### Actual Content

We're open for business!

After moving back to Barcelona this summer, spending most of it getting settled and trying to survive 35+ degree weather, I'm now ready to take on new opportunities.

The summer has also been spent my building educational material for Go developers and creating a no-code blogging tool, aimed at start-ups and SMBs. However, I'm starting to itch for working with other people in the start-up space again.

If you, or somebody you know, is looking to add a senior Go engineer, I would love to have a chat with you.

**TBD** - sep 19, 2024

**You are not fang** - sep 11, 2024
The requirements of Google, Meta, Netflix are not your requirements

While this seems like an obvious statement, it's easy to get caught up in the hype of cutting-edge tech and complex architectures. I see it all the time. 

But most projects don't need the scalability of Facebook or the processing power of Amazon. Overcomplicating your stack often leads to slower development, higher costs, and maintenance nightmares.

The truth is, your clients doesn't care about the underlying tech stack or if you use a million micro-services. They need solutions, not buzzwords. Focus on choosing the right tools for the job, not the trendiest ones. Simple, well-executed solutions often outperform over-engineered behemoths.

We need to get back to YAGNI - you're not going to need it.

What's your go-to tech stack for most projects? Share your pragmatic approach in the comments.

## About Section

**Personal Page**
Current:
Hi, I'm Morten.

Software Engineer with 7+ years of experience working in fast-paced and fast-changing startup environments to large SP500 corporations.

I specialize in Golang and have used the language to successfully deliver various small and large-scale projects throughout my career, from legal tech to advertisement.

If you need an extra pair of hands, are curious about adopting Golang in your tech stack or need to scale your product, please feel free to reach out to me on: linkedin@mbvlabs.com.

WIP:
Starting out wanting to wear expensive suits while working in the high rises of London's financial district, I started my journey studying finance. But during my studies, there was an increaing nagging feeling that something wasn't right which cumulated[wrong] during writing my master thesis. I was writing an event study trying to determine statistically, if trades done by insiders in companies listed on Denmark's C25 index had excess returns. I.e. could you, using those trades at different intervals, hope to receive an abnormal return. Unless you also studied finance that description probably put you half to sleep. It did that to me aswell, but one part of the thesis was super interesting to me. I had used Python to run the analysis for the approximately 4000 handpicked observations.

I quickly scrapped my dreams of be an investment banker and turned towards software teaching myself the craft through whatever material I could get my hands on.

My roughly ~8 years of professional software development as majorily been spend working in the hectic, chaotic and absolutely wonderful environment that is tech start-ups/scale-ups/small-medium sized companies.

I've worked with Golang, React, Ruby on Rails, PHP, Symfony, Django, Typescript, Python, Java on platforms such as Amazon Web Services (AWS), Google Cloud Platform (GCP), Hetzner, Digital Ocean, Heroku. From hosting my own servers to building fully serverless apps, in various industries ranging from legal to green tech, crypto to media and pharma and life sciences, across multiple continents and countries, I've seen my fair bit of code and projects.

While reading a bunch of programming languages and platforms doesn't help you much in determining if I'm a good fit for your needs, it hopefully indicates the breadth of knowledge accumulated.

These experience has given me an unique insight to building technical products especially how to focus on moving the needle in the right direction, quickly finding product-market fit and ultimately scaling both the tech and team behind it.

WIP 2:
I didn't start out in software. 

Once, I wanted to be an investment banker that wore expensive suits and made million dollar deals in London's financial district. I went as far as finishing a masters in finance before an event would change my career trajectory.

While working on my master's thesis—something called an event study, believe it or not—I used Python for crunching the statistics as I had dabbled a bit with software in online courses during my studies. I found myself enjoying writing and solving my problem with code way more than I did doing the actual financial analysis. During my thesis defence I was even told that the statistical work as very impressive but the presentation of the results was abit lacking.

I quickily did a pivot into software engineering and building technical products where, for the past 8 years, I've thrived in the exhilarating ecosystem of tech startups and SMEs, where fast iteration and problem solving is key to become profitable and grow.

Software has taken me across continents and industries, from legal tech to green green, from media to pharma. I've built apps using Golang, Ruby on Rails, Typescript, React. I've built serverless apps that had a sub 100ms responsive time during the Super Bowl, setup infrastructure on AWS and GCP to serve large data pipelines and clusters of machine learning models to a simple VPS setup on one of the many options out there.

But beyond the tech stack and infrastructure, I've gained invaluable insights into:

- Rapidly finding product-market fit
- Scaling both technology and teams
- Focusing on metrics that truly move the needle
- Keeping software as simple as possible, for as long as possible

This last point has become a cornerstone of my approach. 

I've learned that maintaining simplicity in software design, even as requirements evolve, is crucial for long-term success. This philosophy allows businesses to remain agile, adjust to shifting market demands, and scale efficiently without accumulating technical debt.

My unique blend of technical expertise and business knowledge allows me to bridge the gap between tech and product, helping startups and SMEs turn their ideas into reality while maintaining the flexibility to pivot when necessary.

From humble beginnings on a farm to mastering the complexities of tech and business, I've forged a path that many said couldn't be done.

Then, everything changed in 2022.

I turned away from the conventional career ladder where I was making a career as a data engineer and a full-stack developer in the buzzing startup scene. I made a bold move, betting on my own unique mix of tech savvy and business acumen to carve out a new destiny.

My venture? To harness the full power of open-source software, blended seamlessly with sharp business insights. This was more than career development; it was about creating a blueprint for turning any idea into reality.

Starting with freelance projects that exceeded €150k in revenue, I quickly realized the potential of sharing my journey. My blog became my megaphone, broadcasting the nuanced art of full-stack development and reaching over 60,000 readers hungry for practical, impactful tech content.

In 2023, fueled by relentless passion, I dove headlong into developing niche SaaS products designed to streamline how businesses operate, commanding over €2k in revenue despite being in their infancy.

Today, I'm fully engaged in the tech community as a developer, mentor, and resource for others, striving to make meaningful impacts as freelancer or indiepreneur.
