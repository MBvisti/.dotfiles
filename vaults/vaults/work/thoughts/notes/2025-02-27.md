main thoughts:
- bootstrap might actually be all you need
- css needing a compile step is kind of wack
- css variables are awesome

been going back and forth with bootstrap for some time now; it looks like all i need on the surfrace level but need to digg deeper to see how things works out when stuff gets complicated. but nothing having to compile and update it all the time is just amazing. also, the layout is so easy and intuitive-i know css grid should be the same but it always seem to have some quirks. definitely a skill issue but i don't want to be good at css. i just want the most responsive and clean looking website with the least amount of knowledge/effort. so bootstrap still seems like a good trade-off to achieve that.

the fact that I just need to provide new values for a bunch of css variables and I have my own color scheme is awesome. way less hassle compared to tailwind.
