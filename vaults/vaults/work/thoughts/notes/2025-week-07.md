# Daily Notes Summary: Feburary 10-14, 2025

These notes reflect a developer's thoughts on balancing self-hosting versus managed services, productivity challenges, and software development philosophy. The author describes shifting towards managed solutions despite loving to tinker, primarily due to time constraints and reliability needs for commercial products. They struggle with concentration and multitasking, advocating for focused work on one project at a time. The notes emphasize simplicity in feature development (using grayscale UIs initially), clear decision-making with few key decision-makers rather than democratic processes, and avoiding getting too attached to specific tech stacks. The author mentions starting to build an analytics tool and experimenting with Bootstrap.
