# February 28, 2025

main thoughts:
- what causes developer burnout (unclear reqs, never finishing projects, bad teammates, etc)
- never finishing projects creates apathy

been feeling a lot of apathy towards my client work lately. nothing seems to ever be done, the product direction changes as often as you'd change your underwear. the requirements are unclear and asking for clarifications results in one-sentence responses. incredibly frustrating.

if you're in a perpetual loop where nothing ever finishes or progresses, it creates a ton of apathy towards the project. unless you LOVE writing unncessary code, undoing changes etc. i know that i've earlier argued for accepting that most code is short-lived or will have to change often, but it should still be towards a goal. something you can point at and say "done, try it out" before new tasks gets piled on top of the existing once. if there are consistently changing direction there are no real direction. and that leads to really bad products.
