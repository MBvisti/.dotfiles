## Outline

**Overall Goal:** Equip participants with the skills to build, manage, and deploy full-stack web applications using Go on their own Virtual Private Server (VPS).

**Learning Approach: Dual Story-lines**

Each module will have a main story line that focuses on theory and key implementation and side stories that shows the complete implementation.

The idea is to make the course more consumable if you don't want to watch all the coding. So a course participant can watch the main story line from start to finish and learn all the material. For extra in-depth, they can see the side stories that shows you everything.

**Main story-line**:
* focus on the what and why
* provide theoretical and practical foundation

**Side story-line**:
* shows everything from start to finish
* will be supplementary to main story line
* should be used for finishing elements that has a lot of duplication (ui work for example)
