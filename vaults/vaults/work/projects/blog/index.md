## Find your rock

**Status**: WIP

**Alternative title**:
- just because the world is changing doesn't mean your tools have to
- simple is at both ends of the bell curve
- conventional wisdow (tech) sticks around for a rason

**Core Idea**:
when building for an ever changing environment where adaptability AND robustness are two key competitive advantages, choosing stable over shiney, becomes an important skill. we've grown to accept that breaking changes for libraries are just a way of life and instead of actively questioning and choosing what was built to last. if you want to ship, find your rock.

## We do product management wrong

**Status**: WIP

**Alternative title**:
- hitchhikers guide to developer burnout 
- scrum deez nuts
- product management is a dictatorship
- too many opinions makes a jira
- scrum will not save you

**Core Idea**:
there is a (perhaps natural) human need to analyze a thing before deciding on how to deal with said thing. most analyze a thing in a well understood (corporate) environment with lots of innate knowledge about the thing. some, do it in an new and poorly (but much more interesting) understood environment that requires different tactics. mainly exploration, throwing spaghetti on the wall to see what sticks and trying to draw conclusion based the wall pattern (i.e. the scientific method). the recipe is simple, gather enough information/data to form a somewhat decent hypothesis, build the absolute minimum you can to reject/validate the hypotheses inspect and learn from the pattern and take actions based on that. estimating tshirt sizes will not help the above.

## Indiehackers Guide to Infrastructure

**Status**: Planned

## Why Go?

**Status**: Released

[source](./why-go.md#why-go)

## One year of main videos

**Status**: WIP

**Alternative title**:
- so you wan to make videos

**Core Idea**:
talk about my learnings on creating programming videos. focus on things like:
- process
- just pressing record
- start from a finished project then plan episodes
- keep them focused
- getting quality to an acceptable level
