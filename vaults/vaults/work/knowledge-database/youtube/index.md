LEARNED:
- from video to short: change project settings to vertical, import video, clip
it and add transform effect to it. Add it again in another track, add transform
to it and make it so that code and face is in it.

## Thumbnails

### Curiosity Gaps

_definition_: Gap between what we know now and want to know
A thumbnails should trigger the urge to close that gap

According to [Aprilynne](#1), there exists these curiosity gaps:
- moment | powerful reaction
- story | sets the scene for the story by introducing tension or creating question
- transformation | going from point a to b
- novelty | something unique; combined with something we're familiar with becomes very powerful
- result` | how can I do it too

### Scroll Stoppers

Faces do very well in thumbnails; our brains are very good at recognizing faces. Works best when the familiarity bias is high, i.e. our brains are naturally drawn to what we're familiar with.

Examples:
- Large numbers, especially with money attached.
- Money
- Danger and movement
- Emotion
- Bright colors
- Aesthetically pleasing

### Thumbnail Design

- Contents
- Composition
- Contrast

**Contents**:
Contents is all the elements that make up the thumbnail, i.e. people, text etc. You can divide the contents into main and supporting characters. 

The main character is what _best_ contributes to the curiosity gap where the supporting characters will do things like provide context, draw attention og add more curiosity.

**Composition**:
For composition, most thumbnails follow one of two alignments: symmetrical and asymmetrical. 

Symmetrical places main character in the center and have left and right look similar.

Asymmetrical uses the rule of thirds, place the main character on the right or left third of the thumbnail.

Text should only be included if it adds to the story of the thumbnail. Like showing scope or intensity, adding context, clarity or provide the source of curiosity. Also worth noting, text takes longer to process for our brains compared to visuals.

_NEVER_ just repeat the video title on the thumbnail; keep it at a max of 5 wors; no big blocks of text; use words people understand; easy to read fonts.

Try to pick Sans Serif fonts with outline and shadow.

Text must never overshadow the main character, i.e. keep the main character the dominant element.

**Contrast**:

When something "POPS" it means that it has good contrast.

Three ways to create contrast:
- HUE
- Saturation
- Luminosity

To create contrast with luminosity you mix lights and darks to better showcase the main character. So if you have dark background colors, you something of the opposite lumionosity (i.e. light) to drive the focus to the element you want and vice versa.

To create contrast with saturation you mix areas of low saturation with high saturiation, e.g. a background with gray scale and bright colors for the main character.

To create hue contrast, you use complementary colors which are colors that are opposite each other on the color wheel.
